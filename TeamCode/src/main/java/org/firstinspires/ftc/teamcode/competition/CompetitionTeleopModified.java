 * This is (mostly) the OpMode used in the goBILDA Robot in 3 Days for the 24-25 Into The Deep FTC Season.
 * https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpytbFEB5mLcWxf6rOHqbmYjDi9BbK00p&si=NyQLwyIkcZvZEirP (playlist of videos)
 * I've gone through and added comments for clarity. But most of the code remains the same.
 * This is very much based on the code for the Starter Kit Robot for the 24-25 season. Those resources can be found here:
 * https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-bot-resource-guide-into-the-deep/
 *
 * There are three main additions to the starter kit bot code, mecanum drive, a linear slide for reaching
 * into the submersible, and a linear slide to hang (which we didn't end up using)
 *
 * the drive system is all 5203-2402-0019 (312 RPM Yellow Jacket Motors) and it is based on a Strafer chassis
 * The arm shoulder takes the design from the starter kit robot. So it uses the same 117rpm motor with an
 * external 5:1 reduction
 *
 * The drivetrain is set up as "field centric" with the internal control hub IMU. This means
 * when you push the stick forward, regardless of robot orientation, the robot drives away from you.
 * We "took inspiration" (copy-pasted) the drive code from this GM0 page
 * (PS GM0 is a world class resource, if you've got 5 mins and nothing to do, read some GM0!)
 * https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/tutorials/mecanum-drive.html#field-centric

/**
 * TODO: Write code for the following ideas, then test:
 *       1) Test Pre-hang routine (gamepad1.y) - adjust the ARM_ATTACH_HANGING_HOOK angle as needed
 *       2) Test Hang routine (gamepad1.x) - can disable if it doesn't seem good
 *       3) Fix horizontal limit code so that slide extends more as it goes up - Mr. Morris needs to see this and maybe add some telemetry to troubleshoot
 *       4) Try variants of code for arm and slide that take cycleTime into account for smoother operation
 *
 * DONE: 1) Create 42" horizontal limit to keep robot arm and slide operating in the legal envelope
 *       2) Implement finite state machine model to track arm preset movements, with delays for arm rotation and slide extension to manage whiplash
 *       3) Intake successful routine (gamepad1.b) - rotate arm up, retract slide
 *       4) Pre-hang routine (gamepad1.y) - fold wrist, retract slide, rotate to hang hook position
 *       5) Hang routine? (gamepad1.x) - rotate arm and drive forward a little bit

    reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
    We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.

           This robot has an extending lift on the end of an arm shoulder. That arm shoulder should
           run to a specific angle, and stop there to collect from the field. And the angle that
           the shoulder should stop at changes based on how long the arm is (how far the lift is extended)
           so here, we add a compensation factor based on how far the lift is extended.
           That comp factor is multiplied by the number of mm the lift is extended, which
           results in the number of degrees we need to fudge our arm up by to keep the end of the arm
           the same distance from the field.
           Now we don't need this to happen when the arm is up and in scoring position. So if the arm

            /* Here we set the lift position based on the driver input.
            This is a.... weird, way to set the position of a "closed loop" device. The lift is run
            with encoders. So it knows exactly where it is, and there's a limit to how far in and
            out it should run. Normally with mechanisms like this we just tell it to run to an exact
            position. This works a lot like our arm. Where we click a button and it goes to a position, then stops.
            But the drivers wanted more "open loop" controls. So we want the lift to keep extending for
            as long as we hold the bumpers, and when we let go of the bumper, stop where it is at.
            This allows the driver to manually set the position, and not have to have a bunch of different
            options for how far out it goes. But it also lets us enforce the end stops for the slide
            in software. So that the motor can't run past its endstops and stall.
            We have our SlidePosition variable, which we increment or decrement for every cycle (every
            time our main robot code runs) that we're holding the button. Now since every cycle can take
            a different amount of time to complete, and we want the lift to move at a constant speed,
            we measure how long each cycle takes with the cycleTime variable. Then multiply the
            speed we want the lift to run at (in mm/sec) by the cycleTime variable. There's no way
            that our lift can move 2800mm in one cycle, but since each cycle is only a fraction of a second,
            we are only incrementing it a small amount each cycle. */

    /**
     * Mr. Morris:
     * This method is a finite state machine implementation to track the possible positions of the arm, slide, and wrist. The
     * main reason this was implemented is because Mahlon asked for a time delay when moving from the HIGH_BASKET down. I
     * interpreted this as hitting the button to go to the COLLECT, however it could be adjusted to behave how the drivers want.
     * Currently it has a timer in the COLLECT case so that the arm delays half a second while the slide retracts. There are
     * certainly simpler solutions to this problem, but this one is more robust and gives us the framework to make all sorts of
     * fancy transitions between states while still being readable. The magic happens at the top of the while(opModeIsActive())
     * loop. It calls this method to update the arm state every loop. Later in the program buttons will change the currentState
     * and the next program loop when the method is called it will update the positions. By being called every program loop
     * regardless of button press it can track timers and even flow from one arm state to another if we want it to. Currently I
     * have each of the states moving to the IDLE state after finishing so that gamepad2 can change the arm and slide positions.
     * Without the IDLE state, updateArmState constantly overrides the gamepad2 controller input.
     * @param state This is an enum of ArmState type. Enums are a way of creating a sort of list of options that can be chosen
     *              by name in a switch statement like this. This makes code more readable and less prone to errors. It is a
     *              description of a position the arm, slide, and wrist can be in (e.g. FOLDED, COLLECT, etc.)
